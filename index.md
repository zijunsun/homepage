### RESEARCH INTERESTS

I am a Research Scientist at Shannon.AI since 2020. Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree at Peking University 
in 2020. My research interests are natural language processing and deep learning.  
My main work is to track the state-of-the-art algorithms in natural language processing. Not only do I research 
basic NLP algorithms(e.g. QA, NER, NLI..), 
but also I explore the practical NLP applications for real-world problems, 
such as document event extraction, text error correction.  
In recent years, with the advancement of pre-training models, I have devoted myself to multimodel pre-training models. 
For Chinese, I proposed a multimodel pretraining model, 
which considered both visual and phonetic information, and this pre-trained model can carry significant syntax and 
semantic information for language understanding.

### INTERNSHIP
2019.6 - 2020.4:  <b>research intern</b><br/>
Advisor: [Dr. Jiwei Li](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~bdlijiwei/), Chief Executive Officer, Shannon.ai <br/>
Topics: Question Answering, Event Extraction<br/>
- Proposed a new paradigm for the task of entity-relation extraction. 
  By casting the task as a multi-turn question answering problem, 
  the extraction of entities and relations is transformed to the task of identifying 
  answer spans from the context.
- Created a novel strategy for the task of named entity recognition (NER). 
  We cast the task as a query-based machine reading comprehension task.
- Implemented a Knowledge Base Question Answering System(KBQA) for the stock market, 
  the pipeline includes tagging, parsing, nl2sql.

2018.6 - 2019.4:  <b>research assistant</b><br/>
Advisor: [Dr. Sujian Li](http://123.56.88.210/), Associate Professor, Peking University <br/>
Topics: Event Extraction, Graph Convolutional Network<br/>
- Proposed a multi-view graph convolutional network for the task of event extraction.
- Introduced shortcut arcs (e.g. AMR, Parse tree, Syntax Tree) to enhance information flow.
- Captured the very long-distance dependencies by graph convolutional neural network.
